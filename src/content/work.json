This rich internet application, a flash-based music video creator, was developed entirely in Adobe Flex which allowed visitors to filter through over 200 short clips and edit their own music video.<br><br>Under the watchful eye of a leading music promo director, Kim Gehrig, the fans filmed the Noisettes playing in a disused swimming pool in East London capturing all the energy and excitement of an exceptional Saturday Night out. The fans were both the cast and crew. The application lived on www.shotbyfans.com and only lived for a few months; the application allowed visitors to edit their own video and share it on Facebook.<br><br>Due to the limitation of Flash in handling video buffers at the time, user made edits were rendered on the server using ffmpeg and previews were made possible by simply playing video samples sequentially and using some client caching techniques.",

With the theme of \"Home is Everything: New York City,\" selected students ranging from grades 3-5 were asked to photograph \"their\" New York City. These images were then translated by Map and placed into an image bank for the application. Students were asked to orchestrate and compose collages using these image banks, determining size, color, and frequency.
